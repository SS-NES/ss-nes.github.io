      In  this project, we consider software sustainability as the collection of practices
      used to ensure reusability and long-term viability of research software, 
      as well as its impact on research.
      These practices encompass software management, software quality, FAIR software, and 
      software preservation.

      Research software, encompassing scripts, code, tools, and digital methodologies, 
      is crucial to academic research, particularly in the Natural Sciences & Engineering 
      (NES) domain. Despite the importance of Research software, attention for software sustainability
      often remains limited.

      This project addressed several aspects of software sustainability 
      to actively support the research community within the NES domain. By providing 
      domain-relevant guidelines, tools, infrastructure, and training, the project 
      supported awareness and uptake of best practices during the entire software life cycle.
