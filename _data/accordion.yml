    subtitle: Guidance on sustainable software for the NES domain
    content: >-
      A software management plan (SMP) aids in implementing best practices during 
      software development and ensures the software remains accessible and reusable 
      in both the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of 
      results and promotes collaborative work on open-source software for research. 
      Moreover, an SMP encourages researchers to plan for the softwareâ€™s long-term 
      sustainability and community uptake of the software.
      

      We created a the [SMP decision tree](#toolkit-smp-decision-tree) to guide 
      you through the process of creating an SMP.

    subtitle: Tools to support sustainable software development
    content: >-
      Guidance for sustainable research development is crucial, but it is also important 
      to provide means to make it practical and applicable during the whole development 
      cycle. If such support is not readily available when the guidance is published, 
      uptake by the community might be significantly delayed.


      In this project, we developed [research software templates](#toolkit-meta-template) 
      that implement the best practices recommended by the guidance and provide boilerplate 
      code and assets to initiate the research software development, including unit tests, 
      documentation, etc. This will allow the researchers to apply the guidance in a much 
      quicker and practical way by using different languages (e.g. Python, R).

    subtitle: Integrating digital infrastructure for sustainable software
    content: >-
      The use of digital infrastructure and services can contribute to enhancing software 
      sustainability, encompassing aspects such as version control, licensing, citation, 
      publication, and long-term preservation. We have integrated and improved existing 
      digital services relevant to the NES domain that support several aspects of software 
      sustainability.


      The 4TU.ResearchData repository aids researchers of the science, engineering and 
      design disciplines with long-term archiving of software. 4TU.ResearchData is the 
      only certified repository in the Netherlands that provides support for sharing and 
      long-term preservation (at least 15 years) of both research data and software and for 
      disciplines from the entire NES domain. The Research Software Directory is a registry 
      developed by the eScience Center that enables both research performing organizations 
      and researchers to find, publish, cite, share, and measure the impact of research software.


      We will write a blog summarising this integration.

      We conducted a train-the-trainer workshops and walk-in sessions aimed at trainers, 
      training coordinators and researchers within the NES domain and at LDCCs. Through these 
      events we shared with participants our best practices for software 
      sustainability in the NES domain.


      Based on these activities we created [training materials](#toolkit-ss-nes-lesson) which 
      can be used by the wider community.
