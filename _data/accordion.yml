    subtitle: Guidance on sustainable software for the NES domain
    content: >-
      A software management plan (SMP) aids in implementing best practices during software development and ensures the software remains accessible and reusable in both the short and longer term. It also contributes to the reproducibility of results and promotes collaborative work on open-source software for research. Moreover, an SMP encourages researchers to plan for the softwareâ€™s long-term sustainability and community uptake of the software.
